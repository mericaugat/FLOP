	Suppose $\bbk\fpsx$ is the algebra of formal power series with freely noncommuting indeterminates $\bbx = \set{x_1,\dots, x_\ttg}$ over the field $\bbk$.
	Suppose $\bby = \set{y_1,\dots, y_\tth}$ is a distinct set of freely noncommuting indeterminates and let 
	\[
		f(\x,\y) = 0
	\]
	be a system of polynomial equations in $\bbk\fralg{\bbx,\bby}$, and let $c$ be a positive integer.
	Then given a formal power series solution $\hat{\y}(\x)\in \bbk\fpsx$, there is an algebraic solution $\y(\x)$ consisting of algebraic power series such that
	\[
		\hat{\y}(\x) \equiv \y(\x) \mod (\x)^c
	\]
\end{problem}


In the classical setting, this problem uses the Implicit function theorem and some refinements of the IFT.
