\begin{problem}[Free L{\"u}roth Theorem]
Suppose $\k$ is an algebraically closed infinite field and $x_1,\dots, x_g$ are freely noncommuting indeterminates ($g\geq 2$).
If $\k\subsetneq D\subsetneq \k\skf{x_1,\dots, x_\ttg}$ is a subfield, then do there exist $q_1,\dots, q_\tth\in \C\skf{x_1,\dots, x_\ttg}$ 
such that $D = \C\skf{q_1, \dots, q_\tth}$?

In other words, is every non-trivial subfield of $\C\skf{\bbx}$ a free skew field?
\end{problem}


\begin{theorem}[L{\"u}roth's Theorem]

Suppose $\k$ is a field. If $\k \subsetneq D \subsetneq \k(t)$ is a subfield, then there exists $q\in \k(t)$ such that $D = \k(q(t))$.

\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
	If $\k$ is algebraically closed and infinite, then L{\"u}roth's Theorem holds as well for $\k(t_1,t_2)$.
	
	On the other hand, there are counterexamples to L{\"u}roth's Theorem for $\k(t_1,t_2,t_3)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
	Schofield {\color{red} ref?} shows that if $f,g\in \C\skf{\bbx}$, then either $[f,g] = 0$ or $\C\skf{f,g}$ is free.
\end{remark}
