
\begin{problem}
	Classify the invertible elements of $\C\skf{\bbx}\otimes \C\skf{\bby}$.
	The expectation is that if $Q$ and $Q^{-1}$ are in $\C\skf{\bbx}\otimes \C\skf{\bby}$, then $Q = r\otimes s$, for some nonzero elements $r\in \C\skf{\bbx}$ and $s\in \C\skf{\bby}$.
\end{problem}

The following was proven in \cite{TensorProd-Swe70} using techniques that seemingly don't translate well to the noncommutative setting.

\begin{theorem}
	Suppose $A$ and $B$ are commutative domains over an algebraically closed field $\k$ and $\k$ is algebraically closed in $A$ and $B$. If $z\in A\otimes B$ is invertible, then $z = a\otimes b$ for some invertible elements $a\in A$ and $b\in B$.
\end{theorem}

The following two simplifications have been proven using Complex Analysis and Realization Theory:

\begin{proposition}
	Suppose $r\in \C\skf{\bbx}$ and $s\in \C\skf{\bby}$.
	If $(1\otimes 1 - r\otimes s)^{-1}\in \C\skf{\bbx}\otimes \C\skf{\bby}$ then either $r$ or $s$ is constant.
	
	Suppose $r_1,\dots, r_\tth\in \C\skf{\bbx}$, $C\skf{s_1\dots, s_\tth}$ is isomorphic as a skew field to $\C\skf{w_1,\dots, w_\tth}$.
	If $(1\otimes 1 - \sum_{i=1}^k r_i\otimes s_i)^{-1}\in \C\skf{\bbx}\otimes \C\skf{\bby}$ then $r_1,\dots, r_k$ are all constant.
\end{proposition}


The tensor product membership problem is strongly related to the rational automorphism problem as well, although that may require an understanding of domains.
