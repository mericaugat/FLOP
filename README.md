Free List Of Problems

The point of the Free List Of Problems (FLOP) is to create a collection of problems/conjectures in Free Analysis that we think are interesting or important for the continued development of the field. Ideally the list will contain several open problems in the field as well as supporting information and documents on the problems. Perhaps also a list of conquests and links to the proofs.

I see several benefits to the FLOP 1 - Research fodder. Having easily accessible resources on open problems might help us solve them. If you get frustrated working on a project, why not pull an even harder problem from the FLOP? 2 - Help people get into the field. People who are interested in working in Free Analysis but don't know where to start could use the FLOP to get a feel for what is being worked on. Good for convincing grad students and colleagues who "need to learn free analysis someday" to actually get into the field. 3 - Plenaries. If the FLOP succeeds and we prove some nice results then we have a neat little story for someone to tell in a plenary. If the FLOP fails and we don't prove anything, then we have a big ol' list to show in a plenary and say, "look at all these interesting open problems."

I will try to start the list off by putting a couple problems in it, I encourage others to add their own problems and add comments or small introductions to things.
