Let $\bbx = \set{x_1,\dots, x_\ttg}$ and $\bbh = \set{h_1,\dots, h_\ttg}$ be a sets of freely noncommuting indeterminates.
Let $\C\fpsx$ denote the formal power series in $\bbx$ and let $\C\skf{\bbx}_0$ denote the rational formal power series.
If $S\in \C\fpsx$ and $w$ is a word, then $[S,w]$ is the coefficient of $w$ appearing in $S$.
For any word $w$ and series $S\in \C\fpsx$, we let $w^{-1}S = \sum_{v\in \fax} [S,wv]v$.


\begin{proposition}
	Suppose $f\in \C\fpsx$.
	If $Df(\x)[\h] \in \C\skf{\bbx,\bbh}_0$ then $f\in \C\skf{\bbx}_0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	For each $1\leq i\leq \ttg$ we let $\partial_i f := Df(\x)[0,\dots,0,h_i,0,\dots,0]$ and note $\partial_i f\in \C\skf{\bbx,\bbh}_0$.
	Next, we write
	\[
		f = c_0 + \sum_{i=1}^\ttg x_i f_i
	\]
	where each $f_i\in \C\fpsx$.
	Hence,
	\[
		\partial_i f = h_if_i + \sum_{j=1}^\ttg x_j \partial_i f_j\in \C\skf{\bbx,\bbh}_0
	\]
	and it follows that $h_i^{-1}\partial_if_i = f_i\in \C\skf{\bbx,\bbh}_0$ since $\partial_i f_i$ is contained in a stable submodule.
	Therefore, $f = c_0 + \sum_{i=1}^\ttg x_i f_i\in \C\skf{\bbx}_0$ since each $f_i$ is rational.
\end{proof}


The argument below shows it for generalized series. Notation and ideas are pulled from \cite{Vol18}.
Notably, if $v$ is a word, $L_v S = \sum_{w\in \fax} [S,vw]$.

\begin{remark}
	Let $\cA = M_n(\C)$ for some $n$.
	If $f\in \cA\fpsx$ then
	\[
		f = f_0 + \sum_{i=1}^\ttg L_{x_i} f
	\]
	and
	\[
		Df(\x)[\h] = \sum_{i=1}^\ttg L_{h_i}Df(\x)[\h] + \sum_{i=1}^\ttg L_{x_i}Df(\x)[\h].
	\]
	If $f_i(\x,h_i) = L_{h_i}Df(\x)[\h]$, then $f_i(\x,x_i) = L_{x_i}f$.
	Hence, if $Df(\x)[\h]$ is rational, then so is $L_{h_i}Df(\x)[\h]$ and consequently so is $L_{x_i}f$.
	Therefore, $f$ is rational since it is a sum of rational series.
